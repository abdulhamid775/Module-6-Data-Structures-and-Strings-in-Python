## Task 5: Demonstrate List Slicing

### Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:

1. Creates a list of numbers from **1 to 10**.  
2. Extracts the **first five elements** from the list.  
3. Reverses these extracted elements.  
4. Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list.

### Script:
`list_slicing.py`

### Example Output:
Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracted first five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed extracted elements: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
